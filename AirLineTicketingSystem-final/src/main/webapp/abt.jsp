			CoMake Airlines was a major airline of India based in Hyderabad and
			focused primarily on domestic routes, along with several
			international services to neighbouring countries in Asia. It was
			state-owned after merger of eight pre-Independence domestic airlines
			and was administered by the Ministry of Civil Aviation. Indian was
			one of the two flag carriers of India, the other being Air India. <br>
			<br> The airline was rebranded as Indian for advertising
			purposes as a part of a program to revamp its image in preparation
			for an initial public offering (IPO). The airline operated closely
			with Air India, India's national overseas carrier. Alliance Air was a
			fully owned subsidiary of Indian. <br>
			<br> The Government of India announced that Indian Airlines
			would be merged into Air India Limited as its wholly owned subsidiary
			. As part of the merger process, a new company called the National
			Aviation Company of India Limited (now called Air India Limited) was
			established, into which both Air India (along with Air India Express)
			and Indian (along with Alliance Air) would be merged. Once the merger
			was completed, the airline – called Air India – would continue to be
			headquartered in Mumbai and would have a fleet of over 130 aircraft.
			The merger was completed on 26 February 2011. <br>
			<br> The airline was set up under the Air Corporations Act, 1953
			with an initial capital of Indian Rupee symbol.svg 32 million and
			started operations on 1 August 1953. It was established after
			legislation came into force to nationalise the entire airline
			industry in India. Two new national airlines were to be formed along
			the same lines as happened in the United Kingdom with British
			Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and British European Airways
			(BEA). Air India took over international routes and Indian Airlines
			Corporation (IAC) took over the domestic and regional routes.
